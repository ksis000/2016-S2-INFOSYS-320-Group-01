CRUD Apps for MusicInstrument Table
========
The app functionality is:

- View a list of MusicInstruments.
- Add, edit, and delete MusicInstruments.

In all cases the tasks are stored in an in-memory collection that's accessed through a RESTful web service.

For more information about the sample see [Consuming a RESTful Web Service](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/web-services/consuming/rest/) and [Authenticating a RESTful Web Service](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/web-services/authentication/rest/).
